      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        Heralded as having “one of the most gorgeous baritones on earth” by The
        Dallas Morning News, baritone Jason Awbrey is an active vocal soloist
        and choral artist. His lyric voice has garnered critical acclaim for his
        performances of literature ranging from the early Renaissance period
        through the 21th century. In a recital of German lieder with Voces
        Intimae, Scott Cantrell of The Dallas Morning News said “everything
        sounded so easy, so natural” and “[it] was sheer magic.”
