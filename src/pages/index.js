      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        Heralded as having “one of the most gorgeous baritones on earth” by The
        Dallas Morning News, baritone Jason Awbrey is a Grammy® nominated vocal
        soloist and choral artist. His lyric voice has garnered critical acclaim
        for his performances of literature ranging from the early Renaissance
        period through the 21th century. In a recent recital of German lieder
        with Voces Intimae, Scott Cantrell of The Dallas Morning News said
        “everything sounded so easy, so natural” and “[it] was sheer magic.”
      </p>

        States, Mexico, and Europe, including Ars Lyrica of Houston, Grammy®
